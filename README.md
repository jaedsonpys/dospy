# DoSPy 

DoSPy, a script to *execute DoS* (Denial of Service) attacks on a specific host, allowing to define the amount of data sent and threads.

The greater the number of data sent, the *greater chance* the host will go down. We tested with 100 threads and a 50,000 byte token being sent to the router, the **traffic was congested** and no one could connect to the Wi-Fi network.

> **We are NOT responsible** for attacks made on servers, the script created is for teaching and learning purposes!
